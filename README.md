# Nyjava
Nyjava is a discord bot base that supports ðŸŽ‰ Discord Slash Commands! ðŸŽ‰
### I'll see where I go with this, I might update it, I might not. Time will tell.
For now though, it's free to use for everyone, and if you find a bug, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub [issue page](https://github.com/Nyvil/Nyjava/issues).

# Getting started
## Nyjava requires a MongoDB database to work. [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/)

After compiling and running the jar for the first time, it will ask you for your bots token and it will create a folder named "Bot" located in the same path</br> as the jar. 
Open said folder, click on MongoDB.json and enter your database credentials. Afterwards restart the bot.

## Important: 
if you created the MongoDB user not in the admin database, go to the DatabaseConnection class and change the authSource string.
